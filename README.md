# What is budget-app?

budget-app is a React Typescript web application, inspired by the book Barefoot Investor. Its intended use is to help the user maximise their savings by creating a spending plan through the use of savings buckets:

# What inspired you to start this project?

There are two main reasons for the creation of this app: 
* I wanted to learn Typescript
* I wanted the ability to plan my savings efficiently and on the fly

As someone who likes to min-max savings, I wanted the ability to change my savings buckets and play around with them to achieve what I felt was the best savings plan for myself. And as much as I enjoy doing maths on napkins, I felt an actual React app would do a much better job at giving me the ability to figure out each bucket!

At the moment, this project is mainly intended for my own use and learning. However, in the future I plan to add a database and tonnes of features to make this app accessible for public use (and also a lot prettier, as it's quite plain at the moment). Everyone should be able to make the best of their savings! :)
